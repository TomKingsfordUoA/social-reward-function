# Versioning

* This project using semantic versioning (see https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* Semantic releases rely on commit messages. Use commitizen to generate compliant commit messages: `cz commit`
* To generate an (appropriately tagged) release, run: `semantic-release version` (this command is idempotent)
