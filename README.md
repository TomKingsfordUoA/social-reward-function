The intent of this library is to provide a standardised framework and reference implementation for online, dense
recognition and quantification of human emotions through multiple sensor modalities, to form a reward function.

This reward function may then be used for one or both of:
1. Evaluating and comparing the behviour of social robots
2. Performing reinforcement learning in social robotics
